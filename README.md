# Car_Number_Plate_Detection_Project
This project automates the detection of car number plates from images using MATLAB and retrieves corresponding owner details from a database. It combines image processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and database querying to provide an end-to-end solution for applications like traffic monitoring, parking systems, and toll collection.
